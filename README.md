#  Deterministic DEX Matching Simulator

###  Overview

The **Deterministic DEX Matching Simulator** is a concept project that demonstrates how **Raiku’s deterministic execution** can transform decentralized exchange (DEX) trading on Solana.

Most Solana DEXs today rely on probabilistic execution — transactions compete based on fees and validator ordering, leading to **MEV**, **front-running**, and **unpredictable latency**.

By leveraging **Raiku’s Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** and **Just-in-Time (JIT)** slot reservations, this simulator visualizes how trades can be executed *fairly and predictably*, independent of validator discretion.

---

### Problem

On current Solana DEXs:
- Transaction order is determined by validator timing and gas priority.
- MEV bots can front-run or sandwich user trades.
- Traders can’t know when their orders will be executed.
- Retry logic increases latency and complexity.

This results in **execution uncertainty**, **unfair trading**, and **institutional barriers**.

---

### Solution

Raiku introduces **deterministic execution** — a model where:
- Developers can **schedule** transaction slots ahead of time (AOT).  
- Apps can reserve slots **just before execution** (JIT).  
- Raiku’s **Ackermann Node** handles retry logic seamlessly.  
- Transactions execute in **predefined order**, not validator preference.

The **Deterministic DEX Matching Simulator** makes this concept tangible through a visual simulation of order flow and deterministic slot execution.

### Concept Design

#### 1. Trade Flow Simulation

A lightweight frontend (React/StackBlitz or Figma prototype) that shows:
- Traders submitting limit orders.
- Raiku assigning deterministic execution slots (Slot #135, #136, etc.).
- Timeline visualization of slot execution order.
- Matched trades executed predictably.

#### 2. Deterministic Matching Engine (Logic Example)

```js
// simplified prototype logic
const slotQueue = [
  { slot: 135, trader: "Alice", side: "buy", price: 102 },
  { slot: 135, trader: "Bob", side: "sell", price: 102 },
  { slot: 136, trader: "Charlie", side: "buy", price: 101 },
];

function executeDeterministically(slots) {
  return slots
    .sort((a, b) => a.slot - b.slot)
    .map(tx => `${tx.trader}'s ${tx.side} order executes in Slot ${tx.slot}`);
}

console.log(executeDeterministically(slotQueue));
